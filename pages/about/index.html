<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
<p>I try to be a warm and friendly human being, and I am proud of being a
come-with-guy. My friends and colleagues know that when they need me, I'm there.
I try to do the right thing, even if that expression is a bit of a cliché
— I think it's a good way of centering myself. I also have strong drive
for success and I will go the extra mile to win.</p>
<p>I am a senior software engineering leader with an interest in technology as an
enabler for people; developers and users alike. My work has had global reach
since 2006, which fills me with equal amounts of pride and dread. Pride because
I think that what I've been part of making has been useful to people, and dread
because I know that it was irresponsible of us as a civilisation to make sand
think.</p>
<p>I'm a lifelong learner, teacher, and storyteller. During my career I have had
the privilege to drive technical strategy across teams, mentor engineers as well
as multiple Master's Thesis workers, implement a strong security stance, and
help research technically complex areas.</p>
<h2 id="on-software">On Software</h2>
<p>I prefer strongly and statically typed systems when I can have them. Learning
and teaching are often the same thing. Code <em>is not</em> documentation. Architecture
is essential, therefore thinking ahead is essential.</p>
<div class="aside">

</div>
    
    
    <p>"Ye who enter here prefer composition over inheritance"</p>

    
</div>
<p>Fluent in Rust, TypeScript, Swift, Java, and Go.</p>
<p>I also know my way around CSS, Android, iOS, OpenGL, WebGPU, wasm, SPAs, Security,
SQL, Networking, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Shells, Message passing systems,
Linux, Windows, macOS, sysadmin, and too many other technologies to mention.</p>
<p>I once wrote a ray tracer in <a href="https://github.com/bes/TR4CE">Java</a> and then another
one to learn <a href="https://github.com/bes/goTR4CE">Golang</a>.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-internet">On the internet</h2>
<p>I toot on <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@ezivkovic">hachyderm</a>,
I push to <a href="https://github.com/bes">GitHub</a>, I blog on this very site,
and I send photos to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/besez">Flickr</a>.
I discuss Rust on <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/u/bes/summary">URLO</a>,
and I ask and answer questions on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/816017">StackOverflow</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hobbies-activities">Hobbies &amp; Activities</h2>
<p>I used to be the chairman of a computer club called Computer Abend Bei Uns,
where I organized LAN parties for 15 years. Most of the LAN parties were conducted
at a time when a computer screen could weigh 10 kg and a computer about as much.
We still get together, but with more family friendly activities.</p>
<p>I used to train, coach and compete in Taekwondo. Competing in a martial art is a
singular experience — adrenaline, focus, and fatigue all wrapped up in one.
Before that I trained and competed in Tennis.</p>
<p>I've been programming since 1994, when two friends of mine got their first
computer. You can read more about that
in <a href="https://zkc.se/blog/memories-of-computing-around-1994/">Memories of computing; around 1994</a>.
Programming is still a hobby of mine, I write hobby projects, I talk about
programming with my friends, and I read a bunch
of <a href="https://zkc.se/blog/rust-atomics-and-locks/">programming books</a> every
year.</p>

<p>I am one of the first five employees on Spiideo's current journey.</p>
<p>Primarily responsible for Spiideo's web applications, iOS application, and the
glue that hold them together. I also contribute to architecture and design
across the stack, and help drive cross-functional projects across multiple
teams. I have responsibility for the technical choices the frontend teams make,
as well as mentoring my fellow engineers and thesis workers. Furthermore, I

<h2 id="sony-ericsson-and-sony-mobile">Sony Ericsson and Sony Mobile</h2>
<p>I had a number of roles during my time at Sony Ericsson and Sony Mobile. I
started writing software for the Sony Ericsson K800i and ended with the
Sony Mobile Z5 Compact.</p>
<p><strong>2012–2015</strong> Senior Engineer<br />
Research and Incubation (R&amp;I) — Co-creator of Sony Mobile's Indoor navigation
application (which later became part of Nimway). Cloud integration and location
based services.</p>
<p>The Research &amp; Incubation department was created from a handful of promising
internal projects that had been started by engineers. Our indoor navigation app
was the first to be admitted, and the first to graduate to become a separate
line of business for Sony Europe.</p>
