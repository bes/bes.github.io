<p>Learning low level concurrency primitives through Rust! I read the book
"Rust Atomics and Locks" by Mara Bos, and it helped me develop my understanding
of, and build an intuition for, how atomics work in modern computers.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>First of all — I highly recommend buying (or borrowing) <a href="https://marabos.nl/atomics/">the book</a>.
Buy locally if you can! <em>Support your local book dealers</em>.</p>
<h1 id="audience">Audience</h1>
<p>Developers that need a deeper understanding of the inner workings of our
programs and machines.</p>
<h1 id="focus">Focus</h1>
<p>To me, the most interesting chapters of the book are <em>Chapter 2. Atomics</em> and
<em>Chapter 3. Memory Ordering</em>. Other parts of the book build on these two
chapters and show us how to create higher level primitives on top of atomics.</p>
<h1 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h1>
<p>To build a standard library for Rust with useful multi-threading primitives like
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html">Mutex</a>, or third-party
APIs like Tokio's <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html">Channel</a>,
we need to have a means of building those primitives.</p>
<p>Atomic operations are one of the necessary building blocks to achieve that.</p>

    <p>It's completely possible to have a solid systems programming career without ever
needing to know about memory ordering or atomics. But it doesn't hurt to know about
them either — They're building blocks for the things that you do use.</p>

<h1 id="atomics">Atomics</h1>
<p>Atomics enable us to share information between threads in a <em>data race free</em> way.
The tools we have in the toolbox are <em>atomic variables</em>, and <em>atomic fences</em>.</p>
<p>Atomic variables are small — way too small to hold any significant amount of data.
The maximum size of an atomic variable depends on the platform but can at least
have the size of a pointer on that platform, meaning 64 bits for modern platforms
like x86-64 or ARM64/AArch64.</p>
<p>If you have an atomic variable, you can write to it from one thread, and the
result will be visible to another thread at some (not too distant) time in the
future, without further synchronization.</p>
<p>The most important attribute of atomics is that it's possible to use them to order
<em>other</em> instructions, meaning it's possible to know that <em>some other data</em> than the
atomic variable itself is ready to read fully and correctly.</p>
<h1 id="memory-ordering">Memory Ordering</h1>
<p>To be able to achieve our goal of correctly and reliably sending data between
threads we need to know <em>when</em> we're allowed to access that data. The term <em>when</em> inside
a computer program, or even inside a computer, is a complicated thing to nail down.</p>
<p>Compilers are <em>allowed to reorder instructions</em>, as long as the end result is the same.
Rust, C, C++, etc. all have one or more optimization steps that reorder and combine
different parts of your code in the name of performance. And that's a good thing,
because otherwise our programs would be slow.</p>
<p>Processors also reorder instructions — pipelined instructions stages, speculative
execution, and other things end up reordering the actual instructions. This is done
because CPUs often wait for things like RAM to be loaded into a cache line, and while
it's doing that it can complete other instructions that are ready to execute.</p>
<p>How do we bring order to this world? We need to have control over the chaos
that are programs running on CPUs. We need to control in which order things
happen. But we don't want too much control. That would slow down our programs — compilers
and CPUs reorder instructions for a reason!</p>
<h2 id="atomic-variables">Atomic variables</h2>
<p>An atomic variable stores a small amount of data, and when you load from it or
store to it, you need to specify a memory ordering flag.</p>
<p>The memory orderings available in Rust are found in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/enum.Ordering.html">Ordering</a> enum:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>The typical methods you will use on atomic variables are</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicBool.html#method.load">load</a> Loads a value from the variable</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicBool.html#method.store">store</a> Stores a value to the variable</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicBool.html#method.compare_exchange">compare_exchange</a>
First checks if the value inside the variable is the expected one, and then replaces it if the check passes</li>
</ul>
<p>There's far more information available in the book, and in the Rust documentation.</p>
<h3 id="relaxed-ordering">Relaxed ordering</h3>
<p><code>Ordering::Relaxed</code> is the weakest ordering. This is useful when simply sharing
data between threads inside the atomic variable, and is the most performant.</p>
<p>Unfortunately <code>Ordering::Relaxed</code> can't be used to prevent the compiler or the processor
from reordering instructions by itself. Using a Relaxed ordering only guarantees that once
written, the value can be safely read from another thread.</p>
<h3 id="release-acquire-ordering">Release &amp; Acquire ordering</h3>
<p><code>Ordering::Release</code> is used to store into an atomic variable, and guarantees that
any instructions before it on the same thread happen-before any instructions after
an <code>Ordering::Acquire</code> load from that same atomic variable on another thread. But
not without a few caveats —</p>
<p>If you store into an atomic variable using the Release ordering, and then load
that same variable on another thread using an Acquire ordering there is a guarantee
that any instructions before the release-store happen-before any instructions
after the acquire-load <strong>if and only if</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The release-store is observed by the acquire-load</em> — example: if the acquire-load sees
an AtomicBoolean change from false to true, and that is the expected precondition
for another instruction to have happened, then the instructions of the release-store
happen-before the acquire-load.</li>
<li><em>The release-store was from the same thread as the instructions expected to have happened-before</em>
— example: If two (or more) threads store into an atomic variable only one
of the threads will have a happens-before relationship with the acquire-load,
namely the thread that had its release-store observed by the acquire-load.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last rule means that if ten threads all release-store (write) to the same
atomic variable, only one of them will have a happens-before relationship with
the acquire-load (read), and only that one thread can be expected to have had
all of its instructions ordered correctly. If we try to read memory written by
any of the other threads at that point, that memory might be improperly written
or synchronized leading to Undefined Behavior.</p>
<h2 id="atomic-fences">Atomic fences</h2>
<p>An atomic <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/fn.fence.html">fence</a> is an
operation that does not read or write any data itself, but can be used together
with reading and writing to accomplish a certain ordering. One interesting property
is that reading and writing can be done using <code>Ordering::Relaxed</code>, and it will still work.
This is mostly useful if there are multiple atomic variables that need to be used
together with a single fence. Another interesting property of an atomic fence is
that it can be issued <em>conditionally</em>.</p>
<p>In short: issuing a Release fence followed by a Relaxed store on one thread,
then issuing a Relaxed load followed by an Acquire fence on another thread
establishes a happens-before relationship between the fence instructions even
though the actual store and the actual load were both Relaxed. This seemed
counterintuitive to me when I read it. Especially the part where the store
and the load happen between the fences instead of before/after them.</p>
<p>The paragraphs in the <em>Rust Atomics and Locks</em> book covering atomic fences had
me asking how fences were supposed to be used. It was all there, of course, but
not clear enough for me to fully understand it without additional resources.

<p>It's almost impossible to know how long to wait for the data to become available
in the second thread. This is because it could be stuck in an L1 cache inside the
CPU, a cache that may "never" be available to us since the threads can live on
different CPU cores.</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we've made sure that the compiler isn't allowed to reorder the data write to
<code>GLOBAL_DATA</code> to <em>after</em> the store of <code>true</code> to <code>atomic_bool</code>.</p>
<p>And we've made sure that the read of the <code>GLOBAL_DATA</code> can't be reordered to before
the load of <code>atomic_bool</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Ordering</code>s we use: <code>Acquire</code> and <code>Release</code>, in the exact places they're used
not only makes sure that instructions can't be reordered by the compiler, they also
inform the CPU to share or flush relevant cache lines (in L1, L2, etc.) in a way that
makes the write to <code>GLOBAL_DATA</code> with <code>Release</code> visible to the next read of <code>GLOBAL_DATA</code>
from the thread that executes the atomic <code>Acquire</code>.</p>
<p>As I wrote in the <em>Atomics</em> section above, atomics is what you use to
"order <em>other</em> instructions". Instructions that aren't protected by a Mutex, or
data that can't fit inside an atomic variable itself. Typically, it's about fully
and correctly writing to some shared memory from one thread, signalling that it's
ready through atomic operations, and then reading that shared data from another
thread.</p>
<p>The <em>other</em> instruction in the example above is the write to the <code>GLOBAL_DATA</code> variable,
which isn't atomic.</p>
<p>It's important to get this right — reading data that isn't fully written is
Undefined Behavior and at that point all bets are off!</p>
<h1 id="that-one-weird-paragraph">That one weird paragraph</h1>
<div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">A quote from Rust Atomics and Locks: Chapter 3. Memory Ordering</div>
    <p>The basic happens-before rule is that everything that happens within the same thread
happens in order. If a thread is executing <code>f(); g();</code>, then <code>f();</code> <em>happens-before</em>
<code>g()</code>.</p>

</div>
<p>I spent way too much time thinking about this paragraph in the book. As far as I
can tell, function calls are allowed to be reordered, since most code can be
reordered.</p>
<p>What I think it means is that the observable effects in that thread at runtime
are the same as if <code>f();</code> happened before <code>g();</code>, not that they were necessarily
executed in that order in software or even in hardware.</p>
<p>The point the book tries to make in the paragraphs after that is that happens-before
relationships between threads only happen for certain types of operations, of
which atomic variables and fences are two.</p>
<h1 id="final-words">Final words</h1>
<p>Use atomics to</p>
<ul>
<li>Send small amounts of data between threads directly inside an atomic variable</li>
<li>Send large amounts of data between threads by creating happens-before relationships
between instructions in different threads using atomic variables and atomic fences</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't stress enough how important the last point is — the capability to order
<em>other</em> instructions than atomic instructions <em>between threads</em>, and use that to
correctly synchronize data between them.</p>
