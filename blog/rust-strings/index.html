<p>During the last 20 years I have used a number of garbage collected and reference
counted programming languages. All of them have a single type for representing
strings. Rust has two types of strings that can be stored in three different
ways.</p>
<p>I want to shortly illustrate how Rust's strings interact with the heap, with the
stack, and with the data segment of your binary, as well as shortly explain what
those things are.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Java, Swift, TypeScript, and Go all have string types that make it irrelevant if
they're stored on the stack or on the heap. A Java string is always heap
allocated, while a Go string may be stack or heap allocated. The point is that
you don't need to know: the way you use the type doesn't change.</p>
<p>Rust doesn't work quite that way. In general, the programmer needs to choose
between types that store data either on the stack or on the heap. The choice
is generally speaking a trade-off between speed and versatility.</p>
<div class="note">

    <p>Please note that this post does not touch upon the topics of UTF8, UTF8 validity,
and so on. Neither does it talk about lifetimes, except for <code>'static</code>, which is
not explained further. This post basically glosses over everything that is not
needed to understand <code>String</code> or <code>str</code>.</p>

<p>We need to take a small detour.</p>
<h1 id="stack-and-heap">Stack and heap</h1>
<p>This is a conceptual view of the stack and heap parts of program memory.
This is probably a virtual memory if you're on a laptop computer or physical
memory if you're on a small embedded hardware without an operating system.</p>

<p>The program above illustrates the difference between putting something on the
stack, which is immediately available to the function, since in some sense the
current stack frame <em>is</em> the function. When something is put on the heap, we say
that it's <em>boxed</em>. In this case the <code>Box</code> is essentialy just a stack allocated
struct, that internally holds a pointer to the heap, where the actual data is
stored. Illustrated by the <code>-&gt;</code> arrows above.</p>
<h1 id="three-types-of-string-storage">Three types of string storage</h1>
<p>A string in Rust can be stored in one of three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the heap</li>
<li>On the stack</li>
<li>In the <code>data</code> segment of the application binary</li>
</ul>
<p>We need one more detour.</p>
<h1 id="application-binary-segments">Application binary segments</h1>
<p>The segments in a binary are often illustrated like this, please note that
this is <em>after</em> loading the binary file from disk into main memory: the stack
and heap segments aren't stored in the binary on disk.</p>
<p>The <code>text</code> segment actually contains the compiled machine code, and the <code>data</code>
segment contains application data found by the compiler while compiling.</p>

<p>In this case, the string <code>"abc"</code> has been found by the compiler and put in the
<code>data</code> segment. When our function is run, the x variable points directly into
the <code>data</code> segment, at the address where <code>"abc"</code> starts. Since the <code>&amp;str</code> also
stores a length, the program will only read three characters when run.</p>
<h1 id="two-types-of-strings">Two types of strings</h1>
<h2 id="string">String</h2>
<p>The first of the two types is <code>String</code> which is the heap allocated, growable,
string type. It's growable, which means that unlike Java it's possible to change
the string as long as there is enough room left. If there isn't enough room, it
will expand its size automatically.</p>
<p>A <code>String</code> may be owned, something like <code>let x: String = String::from("abc")</code>,
or referenced <code>fn takes_string_ref(x: &amp;mut String)</code>.</p>
<p><code>String</code> is implemented as a wrapper around <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="str">str</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html">str</a> is simple, but also
very very complicated. You can either accept the standard explanation without
further questioning it, or you can read my take below 👇.</p>
<p>A <code>str</code> is a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html">Dynamically Sized Type</a>.
Furthermore, it is a primitive type, and unlike <code>String</code> you can't find it in the
standard library since it's a compiler internal type.</p>
<p><code>str</code> is callad a "string slice". Unlike most other types you can NOT get an
instance of a raw <code>str</code>. It is is most often seen with  its buddy Mr. Ampersand,
as in: <code>&amp;str</code>. Other possibilities are <code>Rc&lt;str&gt;</code> and <code>Box&lt;str&gt;</code>. The use case
for <code>Box&lt;str&gt;</code> <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/use-case-for-box-str-and-string/8295/4">is that it doesn't contain</a>
the <code>capacity</code> field of <code>String</code>, so it takes up less memory.</p>
<p>Just like a <code>&amp;i64</code> is a reference to an actual <code>i64</code>, an <code>&amp;str</code> is a reference.
But a reference to what? An <code>i64</code> can be stack allocated, so the <code>&amp;i64</code> is
a pointer to some other place in the stack. A <code>Box&lt;i64&gt;</code> is heap allocated,
and you can get a <code>&amp;i64</code> reference to that one, too.</p>
<p>But the <code>&amp;i64</code> isn't just a pointer, it has an implicit size too.
The compiler knows that since the type is 64 bits, it knows how much data to read
when reading the pointed-to reference. But what size is an <code>&amp;str</code>?</p>
<div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">Aside</div>
    <p>Since the Rust 2018 edition, we need to put references to trait objects,
which have an unknown compile-time size,
behind the <code>dyn</code> keyword: <code>&amp;dyn MyTrait</code>. That way the compiler knows to
generate a vtable (a table of function pointers) that the runtime can use to find
the functions of the actual underlying struct. <code>dyn MyTrait</code> is a Dynamically
Sized Type too, and it also has to be pointed to by a <code>&amp;</code> reference, or be
boxed somehow: e.g. <code>Box&lt;dyn MyTrait&gt;</code>.</p>

</div>
<p>But what about <code>&amp;str</code>? A pointer to a string isn't enough, the computer must know
how many bytes of data to read. Fortunately, it does contain the length too,
just as a <code>&amp;[u8]</code> reference knows how many bytes to read behind the pointer.</p>
<p>I think there are nice similarities between how the lack of a known compile
time size of a <code>str</code> forces the runtime code to store the runtime length together
with the pointer to the actual data, and how references to trait objects need to
store a pointer to a vtable to work properly. They're both Dynamically Sized Types
too.</p>
<p>So a <code>&amp;str</code> is basically <code>type str { pointer: *const u8, len: usize }</code>.
Maybe it would have been less confusing if <code>&amp;str</code> was presented another way?
What about <code>&amp;str[u8; ?]</code>. <em>No that's terrible, never write that again.</em></p>
<p>The way <code>str</code> is presented by the standard documentation leads me to believe
that the <code>&amp;</code> in <code>&amp;str</code> is the actual pointer, and that the <code>str</code> part is just
a placeholder for <code>len: usize</code> and an implicit data type <code>u8</code>. But that's
maybe wrong, probably?</p>
<p>My personal take is that <code>str</code> <em>could</em> have been a standard library type, or
a <code>struct</code> instead, and used without it being a reference "<code>&amp;</code>". That way
the pointer field could have been seen in code, and all would have been well.
But since Rust is Rust, and <code>&amp;</code> means shared reference, all the standard rules
around lifetimes and sharing kick in. That results in an overall nicer experience.
However, I find the lack of a deeper explanation or what-if explorations unsatisfying.</p>

<p>The standard library <code>String</code> is always heap allocated, but it can interact with
<code>&amp;str</code> in two ways</p>
<ol>
<li>Anything that takes a <code>&amp;str</code> can take a reference to a <code>String</code> and it will just work</li>
<li>We can get a <code>&amp;str</code> sub-slice of a <code>String</code> by doing <code>&amp;my_string[1..3]</code> which for
the <code>String</code> <code>"abcd"</code> would be <code>"bcd"</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither (1) nor (2) above need to allocate any extra memory except for the size
of the pointer and the length.</p>
<p>Here we allocate an empty <code>String</code> on the heap, and our handle to it, called <code>x</code>
is on the stack:</p>

<p>There's a bit of lying going on above, since String itself doesn't have the pointer,
it's a wrapper around <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>, and the <code>Vec</code> has the actual pointer.</p>
<h2 id="data-segment">Data segment</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, all string literals, e.g. <code>let x = "hello"</code>, will have
the type <code>&amp;'static str</code>, and they are stored in the <code>data</code> segment of the application
binary.</p>

<h2 id="stack">Stack</h2>
<p>It's possible to store string data on the stack, one way would be to create an
array of <code>u8</code> and then get a <code>&amp;str</code> slice pointing into that array.</p>

<h2 id="stack-strings-and-hybrid-strings">Stack strings and Hybrid strings</h2>
<p>For stack allocated strings, or for hybrid stack/heap implementations, there are
a number of crates available. Use your favorite search engine to find them.</p>
<h1 id="a-helpful-tip">A helpful tip</h1>
<p>The reference variety of <code>String</code>: <code>&amp;String</code>, should be avoided in favor of <code>&amp;str</code>,
unless there is a need for a "String out parameter". A "String out parameter", or
<code>&amp;mut String</code>, can be used when a currently owned String needs to be updated by
a receiving function, without having to move it into, and then out of, that function.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>String</code> for strings you need to change, or where a <code>String</code> is a required parameter.</li>
<li>Use <code>&amp;str</code> as function parameters when you need to read string data, since all types of
strings can be cheaply turned into <code>&amp;str</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>&amp;mut String</code> only when you need a "String out parameter".</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="final-words">Final words</h1>
<p>We learned that</p>
<ul>
<li><code>String</code> is for growable strings on the heap.</li>
<li><code>[u8; N]</code> (byte array) is for strings on the stack.</li>
<li>string literals <code>"abc"</code> are strings in the <code>data</code> segment.</li>
<li><code>&amp;str</code> is for peeking into string slices allocated on the
heap, in the <code>data</code> segment, or on the stack.</li>
<li>How <code>&amp;str</code> points into the different types of string storage.</li>
</ul>
