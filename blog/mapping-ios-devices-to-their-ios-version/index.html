<p>I have an iOS app where I need to know what the latest available iOS version for
a given iOS/iPadOS device is, but surprisingly I couldn't find any off-the-shelf
solutions. I'm going to publish one myself. I will probably regret this.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h1 id="encouraging-users-to-update-their-phone-or-tablet">Encouraging users to update their phone (or tablet)</h1>
<p>At <a href="https://www.spiideo.com/">work</a>, we are working on an iOS/iPadOS —
or simply iOS, even if that is somewhat incorrect —
app that has a lot of functionality, and some of our functionality is simply better
(the underlying platform is more bug free) or we are accessing certain platform
APIs that are only available on later versions. So we want to push users to
upgrade to the latest iOS version.</p>
<p>For that we have a modal dialog that pops up whenever the user opens the app,
but at most once every twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Problem is, it's popping up even though some of the users are on the latest
available version of iOS. We have a minimum iOS version of 15, but there are
relatively recent devices that are stuck on iOS 16. <code>iPhone10,6</code> (iPhone X) and
<code>iPad6,8</code> (iPad Pro 12.9-in. – 1st generation) are two models that are unreasonably
stuck on iOS/iPadOS 16.</p>
<p>So we are asking users to upgrade to a later version of iOS than what's possible,
and I'm sure that's at least a little annoying for them.</p>
<h1 id="introducing-ios-hw-to-os">Introducing <code>ios-hw-to-os</code></h1>
<p>Now there exists both a (currently incomplete) JSON file in my
<a href="https://github.com/bes/ios-hw-to-os">ios-hw-to-os</a> repository,
and a simple Swift package called <a href="https://github.com/bes/ios-hw-to-os-spm">ios-hw-to-os-spm</a>
that makes it easy to use from your Swift or Swift-XCode application.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how to use the API</p>

<p>Parsing the iOS version into a usable data structure / type is left as an exercise
to the reader — we already have that at work — but it shouldn't be too
hard and isn't strictly necessary from the point-of-view of the library.</p>
<h1 id="some-wikipedia-some-yaml-some-json-some-rust-and-some-swift">Some Wikipedia, some YAML, some JSON, some Rust, and some Swift</h1>
<p>I used Wikipedia as my source of information, specifically these pages —

</ul>
<p>I manually copied the information into a YAML file, because even though I don't
particularly like whitespace-as-strucutre, it has some features that JSON sorely
lacks – readabilty &amp; comments. The file looks like this:</p>

<p>I then use a very small Rust program to convert the YAML into JSON. The JSON file
has a very different structure from the YAML file. The YAML file is structured
to be easy to update, and is sectioned by type of device, while the JSON file
is basically just an array of all the devices without any sectioning.</p>

<p>After creating the JSON file, that one is copied over to <a href="https://github.com/bes/ios-hw-to-os-spm">ios-hw-to-os-spm</a>

API? PRs are welcome, and I think I left reasonably
clear instructions on how to manage the YAML / JSON structure.</p>
