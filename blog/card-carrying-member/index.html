<p>Three years, eight months, and two days ago I started a local project on my
computer called <code>my-little-rust</code>. I tried out some <code>match</code> statements, I <code>Box</code>ed
a few things, and I haven't stopped since.  It seems I'm a card carrying member
of the Rust Evangelism Strike Force now.</p>

<p>I had heard of Rust a few years before that. I think my friend Jonas sent me
an image of a printed version of <em><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Programming Language</a></em> book.
Since then, I've become a card-carrying member of the Rust Evangelism Strike Force.</p>

<p>Today, while answering a question on the Rust users forum, I was reminded that I
joined on December 7, 2019. And it made me wonder when I started using Rust.
<code>gfind -name "*.rs" -type f -printf '%T+ %p\n' | sort | head -n 1</code> helped with
that. I created the <code>my-little-rust</code> project on November 21, 2018.
I've written thousands and thousands of lines of Rust since then, but I hope that my most
important contribution will be spreading the use of Rust where I work, as well
as helping others on <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/">URLO</a>, StackOverflow, Reddit,
and everywhere else.</p>
<p>I had a bunch of blog posts that I have been revisiting over the
last few years, and I thought it could be a good idea to share them.
So without further ado, I present — The <a href="/rust-resources">Rust resources</a> page.</p>
