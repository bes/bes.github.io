<p>In which I reminisce about the first PCs I came into contact with, as well as
our own software â€” GKO â€” <em>Gammalt Kinesiskt OrdsprÃ¥k ("Old Chinese Proverb")</em></p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>In 1994, my friends Stefan and Paul (brothers) had just got a new computer, a Compaq machine if I
remember correctly. They were the first kids that I knew that had got a computer.
I think it was an all-in-one computer, maybe it was one of these, a CDS 524:</p>
<a class="image" href=".&#x2F;compaq_cds_524.png">
    <img src=".&#x2F;compaq_cds_524.png" style="width: 100%; object-fit: cover;" />
</a>
<p>Before that I had only ever touched my paternal grandfather's old computer that
booted from 5.25-inch floppies straight into a "word-processor" and whatever
gibberish I wrote could be printed on a matrix printer.</p>
<p>Anyway. Stefan &amp; Paul's computer booted MS DOS and then
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x">Windows 3.1</a> on top of that.
Playing a computer game meant shutting down Windows, and going into the DOS
prompt. I guess their father Istvan taught them, because YouTube wasn't to be
invented for another 11 years. "Searching the internet" definitely wasn't a thing.
Istvan was either studying manuals or asked unknown 1994-era computer geeks ðŸ‘»</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet_in_Sweden">the history if internet in Sweden</a>
the first internet connections were available in 1994. But not to us. Certainly not to us.
Interestingly, HSB BRF Hilda (where Stefan &amp; Paul lived) would be one of the first areas
in Sweden where everyone got 100 Mbit connections with an Ethernet plug in each apartment
and a low cost to boot. But at that time I had already moved to Kristianstad. But I digress.</p>
<p>Our unnamed hero taught Istvan who taught Stefan &amp; Paul, who then
taught me, how to open the MS DOS QBasic editor. There we found a game we could
play called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_%28video_game%29">Gorillas</a>.
It looked like this:</p>
<a class="image" href=".&#x2F;gorillas_screenshot.png">
    <img src=".&#x2F;gorillas_screenshot.png" style="width: 100%; object-fit: cover;" />
</a>
<p>I remember us trying to figure out how to change things in the source code. It
was gibberish to me then, but someone figured out how to change stuff
like colors, and banana speed.</p>
<p>Before all of this my most eye opening computer experience had to have been
using the Amiga Workbench to produce speech from text. That was amazing and
helped cement my love for computers. I owe thanks to whoever created that gem.
Friends of mine had crates of Amiga diskettes which were copied at their house
after school. Everyone seemed to have an infinite number of games.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Giana_Sisters">Giana sisters</a> which was
both a Super Mario Bros rip-off and original in its own right.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_World_(video_game)">Another World</a> was an
amazing computer game that we played on the Amiga and I can't believe it was
released in 1991:</p>
<a class="image" href=".&#x2F;another_world.png">
    <img src=".&#x2F;another_world.png" style="width: 100%; object-fit: cover;" />
</a>
<p>I never had an Amiga though. I had a NES 8-bit system, which was great, but I
only had about 8 games. And it had been going strong since around 1989. The only
"piracy" I did was hooking it up to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Genie">Game Genie</a>
which let anyone with a <em>Game Genie Manual</em> skip levels and get health boosts.</p>
<p>We played a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckTales_(video_game)">Duck Tales</a>
on my friends Ricardo and Carlos' (brothers) Commodore 64. I always felt it was such a hassle to
rewind the tapes though.</p>
<p>After 1994 the home computer revolution really got started in Sweden.
Ricardo &amp; Carlos' father worked with computers, so they were also very early.
During recess, we would run to their apartment and play
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft:_Orcs_%26_Humans">WarCraft</a>
in their parents' bedroom. It was always a race against time to run back
to school in time. My best friend at the time, Samy, also got a computer
around this time, but I think it might have been in 1995 or early 1996.
His Packard Bell computer booted into this madness:</p>
<a class="image" href=".&#x2F;packard_bell_navigator.png">
    <img src=".&#x2F;packard_bell_navigator.png" style="width: 100%; object-fit: cover;" />
</a>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packard_Bell_Navigator">Packard Bell Navigator</a>
was an alternative shell for Windows 3.1 that was supposed to be "easy to use".
Thankfully it didn't take long to go the way of the Dodo.</p>
<p>Anyway, anyway. Sorry. Back to 1994: QBasic was beautiful magic. Somehow, probably
with Istvan's help, we managed to learn some QBasic. And we put it to good use, too.
I still remember how much fun it was to run our program and see the results.
I don't remember whose idea it was to make a random sentence generator, and I
don't remember what the code looked like. I do remember laughing so hard I almost
passed out from not getting enough air.</p>
<a class="image" href=".&#x2F;gko.png">
    <img src=".&#x2F;gko.png" style="width: 100%; object-fit: cover;" />
</a>
<p><em>HÃ¤ll aldrig olja i din grannes parabolantenn</em>, <em>Never pour oil in your neighbor's satellite dish</em>,
funnier words have never been spoken by anyone, let alone a computer â€” signed twelve-year-old me.
We named it <em>Gammalt Kinesiskt OrdsprÃ¥k</em>: <em>Old Chinese Proverb</em>. It was promptly
shortened to GKO. We expanded the list of sentences over time but it was hard to
recreate the kick of the first few days. I'm a bit sad that someone didn't realize that
saving the source code was worthwhile. Years later, around 96-97 I would get my
own PC, and after crashing it a few times I started a somewhat rigorous backup
scheme. First on 3.5-inch floppies and then on CD-ROMs.</p>
<p>Much later I got to hear that ideas are worthless. In 1994 no one was asking
us to create something that didn't exist before, and the act of creation was and
is a wonderful thing. There are a lot of caveats, of course, but they seem self-evident.
The list of caveats will vary over time as well. The one that finds this a week, a year,
a decade, or more from now will have to apply the ethics of their respective times.</p>
<p><em>Gammalt Kinesiskt OrdsprÃ¥k</em> started me on a long path of programming. I'm still
programming, and I still think it's a lot of fun to be in the creative state of mind.
Taking ideas and making them into something tangible.</p>
<p>I have one more game I want to mention. Years before, I had the pleasure to play
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkiFree">SkiFree</a> on my uncle's monochrome
(red monochrome to be exact) "portable computer". It was the size of your regular pizza-box
computer, required to be plugged into the wall to run, and had a very small LCD screen
built-in that you could lift out of the chassis. SkiFree is the game where you
ski downhill trying to jump over things and avoid obstacles, and you can do that
for as long as you like, or at least until the <em>Yeti</em> gets you.</p>
<a class="image" href=".&#x2F;ski_free.png">
    <img src=".&#x2F;ski_free.png" style="width: 100%; object-fit: cover;" />
</a>
<p>I still have a lot of memories of computing, probably many more than I will ever
have the energy to write about, but I hope I'll return to the world of Stefan,
Paul, Ricardo, Carlos, and all of the other kids that went through the motions of
grades one through eight in RosengÃ¥rd, MalmÃ¶, Sweden during the 80's and 90's.</p>
