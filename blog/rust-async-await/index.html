<p>Async / await in Rust promises to simplify concurrent code, and to allow a large
number of concurrent tasks to be scheduled at the same time — with less overhead
than the same number of OS Threads would require.</p>
<p>In general, async / await lets you write code that avoids "callback hell", in
favor of a linear style similar to <em>blocking</em> code while still letting other
tasks progress during awaits.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Any minimal async / await code in Rust is made up of at least the following
pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>An executor</li>
<li>A Future with an internal state machine</li>
</ul>
<p>But before we dig into those, let's see what operating system threads are all
about.</p>
<h1 id="operating-system-threads">Operating System Threads</h1>
<p>Rust has a really good concurrency story. For me it's probably the feature I
like the most. Rust prevents you from making a lot of mistakes, mistakes that
are easy to make in most other imperative programming languages.</p>
<p>Each new thread allocates a stack, with an OS-defined size. On linux, and other
operating systems with virtual memory, the program won't actually use up
physical memory even though 1 MiB is "allocated" to the thread when it starts.
That way you can start thousands of threads without trouble.</p>
<p>The problems start when the OS needs to context switch between threads, and a
lot of CPU time is wasted during signalling between the kernel and the program.</p>
<p>Enter async / await.</p>
<h1 id="async-await">Async / await</h1>
<p>Since async / await tasks don't require OS signalling to context switch, the
theory is that you can have a lot more of them, and they can make your program
execute faster than a program with the same number of operating system threads.</p>
<p>The two most important parts of the async / await story are the executor, and
the state machine wrapped in a future.</p>
<p>A future is a computation that will finish and yield a result at some later,
unknown time. Futures don't have to be executed in an async / await context,
they are a tool that is available even in the absence of async / await.</p>
<p>An executor is the thing that takes the state machine futures and drives them to
completion.</p>
<h2 id="executors">Executors</h2>
<p>Rust purposefully doesn't include an async / await executor in the standard
library. There might be executors that are good for small embedded devices, and
other executors that are good for large servers.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, I will pick the very
popular <a href="https://tokio.rs/">tokio</a> executor and describe how it works at a high
level.</p>
<p>Tokio in multi-threading mode starts as many operating system threads as there
are cores on the given machine, on my computer that would be 8 logical cores
which translates to 8 threads.</p>
<p>The "low" number of threads means that if there are 8 currently running tasks,
one in each thread, and all of them are blocking (e.g. stupidly
calling <code>std::thread::sleep</code>), then it would not be possible for any other tasks
to make progress and my hypothetical web server would be frozen.</p>
<p>That's why Alice Ryhl, one of the maintainers of tokio, says that a task should
<a href="https://ryhl.io/blog/async-what-is-blocking/">not execute for more than 100 microseconds</a>
between two <code>.await</code>s.</p>
<p>If a task needs to run for a longer time, then it should be spawned using e.g.
<code>tokio::task::spawn_blocking</code> which will run on a separate OS thread, or just
run the code on an os thread directly using <code>std::thread::spawn</code>.</p>
<h2 id="futures-and-state-machines">Futures and state machines</h2>
<p>An async function looks something like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" class="language-rust z-code"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span class="z-source z-rust">async <span class="z-meta z-function z-rust"><span class="z-meta z-function z-rust"><span class="z-storage z-type z-function z-rust">fn</span> </span><span class="z-entity z-name z-function z-rust">my_task</span></span><span class="z-meta z-function z-rust"><span class="z-meta z-function z-parameters z-rust"><span class="z-punctuation z-section z-parameters z-begin z-rust">(</span></span><span class="z-meta z-function z-rust"><span class="z-meta z-function z-parameters z-rust"><span class="z-punctuation z-section z-parameters z-end z-rust">)</span></span></span></span><span class="z-meta z-function z-rust"> <span class="z-meta z-function z-return-type z-rust"><span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-rust">-&gt;</span> <span class="z-meta z-generic z-rust"><span class="z-support z-type z-rust">Option</span><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-generic z-begin z-rust">&lt;</span><span class="z-support z-type z-rust">String</span><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-generic z-end z-rust">&gt;</span></span></span> </span><span class="z-meta z-function z-rust"><span class="z-meta z-block z-rust"><span class="z-punctuation z-section z-block z-begin z-rust">{</span>

</span></code></pre>
<p><code>async fn</code> is just sugar for transforming the return parameter into a <code>Future</code>
that is implemented as an anonymous struct that can't be named by anyone but the
compiler.</p>
<p>The resulting high level code transform (ignoring the anonymous struct) would be
something like:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" class="language-rust z-code"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span class="z-source z-rust"><span class="z-meta z-function z-rust"><span class="z-meta z-function z-rust"><span class="z-storage z-type z-function z-rust">fn</span> </span><span class="z-entity z-name z-function z-rust">my_task</span></span><span class="z-meta z-function z-rust"><span class="z-meta z-function z-parameters z-rust"><span class="z-punctuation z-section z-parameters z-begin z-rust">(</span></span><span class="z-meta z-function z-rust"><span class="z-meta z-function z-parameters z-rust"><span class="z-punctuation z-section z-parameters z-end z-rust">)</span></span></span></span><span class="z-meta z-function z-rust"> <span class="z-meta z-function z-return-type z-rust"><span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-rust">-&gt;</span> <span class="z-meta z-generic z-rust">Future<span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-generic z-begin z-rust">&lt;</span>Output = <span class="z-meta z-generic z-rust"><span class="z-support z-type z-rust">Option</span><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-generic z-begin z-rust">&lt;</span><span class="z-support z-type z-rust">String</span><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-generic z-end z-rust">&gt;</span></span><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-generic z-end z-rust">&gt;</span></span></span> </span><span class="z-meta z-function z-rust"><span class="z-meta z-block z-rust"><span class="z-punctuation z-section z-block z-begin z-rust">{</span>

</span></span></span></span><span class="z-source z-rust"><span class="z-meta z-function z-rust"><span class="z-meta z-block z-rust">    <span class="z-comment z-line z-double-slash z-rust"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-rust">//</span> finally yields an Option&lt;String&gt;.
</span></span></span></span><span class="z-source z-rust"><span class="z-meta z-function z-rust"><span class="z-meta z-block z-rust"></span><span class="z-meta z-block z-rust"><span class="z-punctuation z-section z-block z-end z-rust">}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>When compiling an async function, the Rust compiler will build a state machine
of the states the function can be in during its asynchronous life cycle. The two
obvious states are <code>Initialized</code> and <code>Complete</code>, but between those any number of
states for different code branches can be generated.</p>
<p>As soon as you call <code>.await</code> on the async function, or enqueue it as a new task
using the regular non-blocking <code>tokio::spawn</code> method, the state machine will
start moving forward. In Rust's async / await model, this is called polling.</p>
<div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">Important note about Futures in Rust</div>
    <p>Unlike many other programming languages that have types named <code>Future</code>, Rust
does NOT start executing a <code>Future</code> automatically. The <code>Future</code> must be driven
forward by something. The most common "something" in async / await is the
Executor. To start driving a future the easiest way is to <code>.await</code> it.
Just do <code>my_task().await</code>.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="what-about-the-stack">What about the stack?</h2>
<p>Regular functions require a stack. In async / await, the Rust compiler will
generate a state machine that is capable of storing the correct amount of data
by encoding every possible combination of stack allocations in the form of an
enum. Interestingly this includes the <em>entire</em> call graph of the async function.
That is why just like recursive types are currently not possible without some
hand waving in Rust, recursive <code>async fn</code> is not possible either - unless you
<code>Box</code> the recursive call. Boxing the call places it on the heap, in essence
<a href="https://without.boats/blog/futures-and-segmented-stacks/">turning it to its own private little "stack" segment allocation</a>
.</p>
<h1 id="when-to-use-async-await">When to use async / await</h1>
<p>Do use async / await when</p>
<ul>
<li>You have to support many concurrent tasks.</li>
<li>You have tasks that call out to non-blocking async functions, e.g. HTTP-calls.</li>
<li>You have an interactive system that gets continuous input while serving output.</li>
<li>You can "guarantee" that your code executes for at most 100 microseconds between <code>.await</code>s.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do NOT use async / await when</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to compute something complex / blocking as fast as possible</li>
<li>You only have a few well known tasks that are independent</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h1>
<p>Unless you fulfill the criteria for async / await, use something else:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw operating system threads <code>std::thread::spawn</code>.</li>
<li>A data-parallelism library like <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">rayon</a>.</li>
<li>I'm sure there are more options out there.</li>
</ul>
