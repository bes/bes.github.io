<p>I recently changed the e-mail address of my Apple ID, but the Find My association
on the mac didn't get the memo.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>This is the story of how I went from a computer that couldn't be transferred to
my colleague, to one that could.</p>
<h1 id="changing-e-mail-of-my-apple-id">Changing e-mail of my Apple ID</h1>
<p>To begin with, I had a mac which was signed in with my Apple ID, let's say
that it was <code>erik.zivkovic@example.com</code>. I was signed in to multiple Apple
service, including "Find My".</p>
<p>When we added "Sign in with Apple" to our web and iOS applications, I had a
problem on my hands - I was already signed in to our dev and prod environments
using my Google Workspace e-mail, which was <code>erik.zivkovic@example.com</code>.</p>
<p>To test Sign in With Apple, I needed a new e-mail address because my old one
was already associated with my Google Workspace credentials (we don't have
many-to-one mappings of credentials).</p>
<p>So I did the "smart thing", I asked to get an extra e-mail address associated
with my Google Workspace profile, and then I changed my Apple ID to use the
new address — <code>erik.zivkovic@example.com</code>.</p>
<h1 id="handing-off-my-old-workhorse-to-a-colleague">Handing off my old workhorse to a colleague</h1>
<p>After wiping the computer properly I handed the computer over to my colleague
who tried to sign in using his Apple ID. Instead of being logged in he was
presented with a dialog box —</p>
<div class="aside">
    <div class="aside-title"><p>macOS dialog</p>
</div>
    
    
    <p><strong>Apple ID Password</strong></p>
<p>Enter Apple ID password for "erik.zivkovic@example.com" to turn off Find My Mac.</p>

    
</div>
<p>Naturally, I tried my Apple ID password. But it didn't work, because my Apple ID
is no longer <code>erik.zivkovic@example.com</code>, it's <code>erik@example.com</code>.</p>
<p>My computer was still enrolled to "Find My", and was being managed by my Apple ID,
with seemingly no way to turn it off.</p>
<h1 id="apple-chat-support-actually-helped">Apple chat support actually helped</h1>
<p>After doing a few rounds with Swedish Apple support, which unfortunately weren't
much help, I decided to try U.S. Apple support.</p>
<p>The nice lady helped me understand what I needed to do, shortly summarized below,
so you don't have to spend hours chatting with support</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the problematic computer is connected to the internet</li>
<li>Sign in to <a href="https://iCloud.com">iCloud.com</a> using your Apple ID</li>
<li>In the map view, there is a dropdown where you can select computers</li>
<li>Select the problematic mac</li>
<li>Select "Erase Mac"</li>
<li>The mac should start erasing remotely</li>
<li>It should now be possible to "Remove from account" — do that</li>
<li>After erasing is complete
<ul>
<li>Use Disk Utility to create a new partition, <code>APFS</code> worked well for me —
call the new partition "Macintosh HD"</li>
<li>Quit Disk Utility, then install macOS</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have an unstuck computer.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/462691/138654">Q/A style answer</a> on
the "Ask Different" StackExchange for this issue.</p>
<h1 id="an-unrelated-but-annoying-bug">An unrelated but annoying bug</h1>
<p>I also ran into an issue where I first used a <code>Mac OS Extended (Journaled)</code>
filesystem for the disk/partition. When trying to install to the "Macintosh HD"
that was formatted using <code>Mac OS Extended (Journaled)</code> I got an annoying error:</p>
<div class="aside">
    <div class="aside-title"><p>Installer popover</p>
</div>
    
    
    <p>The operation could not be completed (com.apple.BuildInfo.preflight.error error 10.)</p>

    
</div>
<p>After scratching my head for a while I tried using <code>APFS</code> for the file system instead
of <code>Mac OS Extended (Journaled)</code>. And it worked!</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/462689/138654">Q/A style answer</a> on
the "Ask Different" StackExchange for this issue too.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>
