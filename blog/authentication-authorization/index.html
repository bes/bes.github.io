<p>In which I discuss the basics of authentication, authorization, and OpenID Connect.
Why?</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Disclaimer: The below blog post was written by me for me, and might (and probably does!)
contain errors. Don't rely on anything below as <em>fact</em>, from now you're on your own.</p>
<h1 id="what-we-have">What we have</h1>
<p>This is typically what you see when you visit pages attempting to explain
authentication &amp; authorization:</p>
<a class="image" href=".&#x2F;webflow.png">
    <img src=".&#x2F;webflow.png" style="width: 100%; object-fit: cover;" />
</a>
<p>The above image specifically covers the Google OAuth 2.0 flow, using Google as an
OpenID Connect Provider. This truly is the future, right? Right? Right.</p>
<p>Another way of describing the flow is from the OAuth 2.0 spec:</p>
<pre>
+--------+                               +---------------+
|        |--(A)- Authorization Request ->|   Resource    |
|        |<-(B)-- Authorization Grant ---|     Owner     |
|        |                               +---------------+
|        |                               +---------------+
|        |--(C)-- Authorization Grant -->| Authorization |
| Client |<-(D)----- Access Token -------|     Server    |
|        |                               +---------------+
|        |                               +---------------+
|        |--(E)----- Access Token ------>|    Resource   |
|        |<-(F)--- Protected Resource ---|     Server    |
+--------+                               +---------------+
</pre>
<p>The images leave a lot to the imagination, but on a high level they show
authentication and authorization information being exchanged.</p>
<p>We need to know more about all the moving parts!</p>
<h1 id="authentication">Authentication</h1>
<h2 id="openid-connect">OpenID Connect</h2>
<p>One way of authenticating is using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect">OpenID Connect</a>,
it's the third generation of OpenID - the first two being OpenID Authentication 1.X,
and OpenID Authentication 2.0.</p>
<p>The two old versions are specific schemes for authenticating users, but were
"unnecessarily complicated". Since everyone is using OAuth 2, OpenID Connect was
implemented to run on top of it - or as the introduction to the spec states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A full list of OpenID specifications can be found on their
<a href="http://openid.net/developers/specs/">Specifications &amp; Developer Information</a>
site. The <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</a>
specification for example.</p>
<p>OpenID Connect is used by a lot of organizations, which lend their authentication
service powers (called OpenID Provider - OP) to our servers (called Relying Party - RP).</p>
<p>Honest question: Why couldn't they just have called it OpenID 3.0 for OAuth 2.0 or something?
When running across "OpenID 2.0" and then something called "OpenID Connect",
naturally you're going to think that the "2.0" is newer
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAjR4_CbPpQ">harder better faster stronger</a>.</p>
<h2 id="other-ways">Other ways</h2>
<p>OpenID Connect is not the only game in town,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Platform#Facebook_Connect">Facebook Connect</a>
is another major player.</p>
<p>You can also try to roll your own authentication service, and if you do that you're
not necessarily constrained to the requirements of OpenID Connect. It's not a bad
idea to be heavily inspired by the work of <em>geniuses</em>, though.</p>
<h1 id="authorization">Authorization</h1>
<p>Let's talk about OAuth 2.0 baby.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydrtF45-y-g">Let's talk about you and me. Let's talk about all the good things, and the bad things.</a></p>
<p>Instead of using the terms <em>OpenID Provider</em> and <em>Relying Party</em>, the OAuth 2.0
spec uses</p>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>It goes on stating <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.1">"The interaction between the authorization server and resource server
is beyond the scope of this specification.  The authorization server
may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.""</a></p>
<h2 id="authorization-grant">Authorization grant</h2>
<p>An <em>authorization grant</em> is the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3">"... resource
owner's authorization (to access its protected resources) used by the
client to obtain an access token"</a></p>
<p>There are four <em>grants types</em> defined in the spec</p>
<ul>
<li>Authorization Code</li>
<li>Implicit</li>
<li>Resource Owner Password Credentials</li>
<li>Client Credentials.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each grant has an
associated <em>Flow</em>, which are ways of obtaining tokens used for authorization after
authenticating a user, the most common being authorization code flow, and
implicit flow.</p>
<h3 id="authorization-code-flow"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1">Authorization code flow</a></h3>
<p>Typically involves a browser (user agent), a web server (client),
a resource owner (user), and an authorization server.</p>
<p>Explained in detail in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1">section 4.1</a>
of the spec, summarized below:</p>
<ol>
<li>The client (server) redirects the UA to the authorization server.</li>
<li>The authorization server authenticates the user and asks the user to <em>grant</em> access.</li>
<li>If access is granted the authorization server redirects the user back to the client (server).</li>
<li>The client (server) requests an access token using the authorization code received in step 3,
the redirection URI is also sent to the authorization server for validation.</li>
<li>The client is authenticated on the authorization server using the authorization code and
redirect URI. If valid, the authorization gives the client an access token (and optionally
a refresh token).</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Summarized</em> means that a lot of detail was left out. Read the spec!</p>
<p>In this flow, the access token never leaves the <em>client</em> (server), instead the
client is connected to the UA/user via e.g. sessions.</p>
<p>I guess the access token can be exposed to the UA anyway, if the implementation
chooses to do that. The takeaway is
that the client uses credentials (typically client secret) issued by the authorization server,
that should NOT be used in the implicit flow. Otherwise it wouldn't be a
<em>secret</em>.</p>
<h3 id="implicit-flow"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.2">Implicit flow</a></h3>
<p>Used when there is no, or you don't specifically have a need for, the client being involved.
The authorization server sends an access token directly to the UA in the redirect.
Typically used by Javascript clients or Android apps.</p>
<h1 id="mixin-it-up">Mixin' it up</h1>
<p>OpenID Connect runs on top of OAuth 2.0 - always keep that in mind when reading
about these two separate specifications!</p>
<p>The concepts of the different specs
and auxiliary technologies like JWT are often presented as one and the same
by third parties (blogs, etc) and one needs to keep that in mind.</p>
<p>OpenID Connect gives you the convenient ID Token, which can be used in parallel
with the OAuth 2.0 Access Token, or separately!</p>
<h1 id="tokens">Tokens</h1>
<p>All of these are (usually) <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWTs</a>. Basically they contain claims, and (AFAIK)
those claims should only ever be trusted if they are digitally signed by the
issuer using e.g. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515">JWS</a>, and that signature should
always be verified by anyone about to trust those claims (e.g. a resource server).</p>
<p>Here's one place to <a href="http://kjur.github.io/jsjws/tool_jwt.html">play around</a> with JWTs
and different types of signatures.</p>
<h2 id="jwt-signatures">JWT signatures</h2>
<p>According to
<a href="https://auth0.com/blog/2015/12/17/json-web-token-signing-algorithms-overview/">auth0</a>
the most common types of signatures are</p>
<ul>
<li>HMAC + SHA256
Creates a signature using a <em>key</em> and a <em>message</em>. The <em>key</em> is the same every time
and the <em>message</em> is the JWT. Common, but more insecure than the asymmetric algorithms below.</li>
<li>RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 + SHA256
Asymmetric signing using RSA. Usually faster than ECDSA.</li>
<li>ECDSA + P-256 + SHA256
Asymmetric signing using ECDSA. Smaller keys than RSA, resulting in smaller JWTs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="id-token">ID Token</h2>
<p>The OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification defines the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken">ID Token</a> in section 2.</p>
<p>There are a <em>bunch</em> of fields, and following the spec for validating the ID Token is
a really good idea. Read the spec. Live the spec.</p>
<p>The ID Token contains claims and typically identifies a user in the context of the OP.</p>
<p>If you are building a service with e.g. Google Sign-In, the ID Token is issued by
Google and <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/backend-auth">according to them</a>
the RP should use the ID Token to uniquely identify a user in the RPs context
(after verifying the integrity of the token).</p>
<p>If you are building your own service and don't have any use for e.g. Google APIs
but you still want to use Google accounts for signing in to your service, just
use the ID Token and forget about the Access Token.</p>
<h2 id="access-token">Access token</h2>
<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.4">"Access tokens are credentials used to access protected resources.  An
access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the
client."</a></p>
<p>Typically, the access token is a JWT token, but according to the spec it doesn't have to be.</p>
<p>The most important thing is, when you need access to an API (resource), use the token that
the authorization server gave you!</p>
<h3 id="access-token-types">Access Token Types</h3>
<p>There are a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-7.1">number</a> of access token
types.</p>
<h4 id="bearer-token">Bearer token</h4>
<p>Whoever presents the token shall be granted access to a resource as long as
the token is valid. This is the most common type of access token.</p>
<h4 id="mac-token">MAC token</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac-05">draft</a> still isn't
finalized, but from what I can gather, the token contains some cryptographic content
that would make it harder to forge and/or read. A probable use case would be
using it in use-cases lacking HTTPS/TLS capabilities.</p>
<p>Don't quote me on that.</p>
<h2 id="refresh-token">Refresh token</h2>
<p>A token used to request new access tokens as they expire. Handy if one wants
to avoid going through the authorization flow once again.</p>
