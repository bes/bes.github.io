<p>My blog is insignificant, and I intend to keep it that way! But besides being
a waste of bytes, it's part of the internet, and the internet is very important
to a lot of people!</p>
<p>Let's play "So what's wrong with ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒?"</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h1 id="so-what-s-wrong-with-cryptocurrency">So what's wrong with cryptocurrency?</h1>
<p>First of all, it has dubious utility except for speculation and criminal activity, and
honestly sometimes those are the same thing. Some people, nice good-meaning people,
don't mind that it's wiping out decades of green energy advances, for reasons unknown
(lmao, I mean exchanging fake internet money for real, usable, money).</p>
<p>Even the purportedly green proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies are still dumb ponzi-
schemes: if you came in early you're smart and rich and if you came in late you
hope to become the former.</p>
<p><strong>Grade: F-</strong></p>
<p>Bottom line: Stay away.</p>
<h1 id="so-what-s-wrong-with-internet-advertisements">So what's wrong with internet advertisements?</h1>
<p>Either you pay for it, or you're the product. There's a lot of wisdom in that. People
my age used to watch a lot of linear TV, and we saw a lot of ads! That fucking sucked,
so when fast home internet met Bittorrent, broadcast TV became irrelevant. Netflix and
others improved on that by making it even easier (for a fee). Too many services and
amazingly, fucking ads, are probably going to make piracy come back like Houthis in Aden.</p>
<p>Website ads are delivering malware straight to your browser, and there's not much you
can do about it, unless you install a privacy-respecting web browser and get a good ad
blocker.</p>
<p><strong>Grade: E</strong></p>
<p>Bottom line: Start paying for IT (amazing pun) - <a href="https://masto.host">Mastodon</a>,
Email, and much more. Reject your surveillance capitalism overlords.</p>
<h1 id="so-what-s-wrong-with-generative-ai">So what's wrong with Generative AI?</h1>
<p>Great for coding. Great for helping you outline a new idea. Great for creating page after
page of SEO optimized bullshit to get more eyeballs on ads.</p>
<p>Hilariously, generative AI probably has a bright future! And that bright future looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace free online resources like Wikipedia with a $20 OpenAI subscription</li>
<li>Make concise texts longer for no reason other than to make them look more impressive than they are</li>
<li>Make long texts short so that our dumb monkey brains don't have to read so much</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately for the users, general-purpose LLMs are extremely mid. Mid in the literal sense:
they express the average of their training set. Meaning that a generated article about Roman
windows from the Middle Ages starts generating text about MS DOS after a title like "What existed
before windows?".</p>
<p>But you should enhance your LLM with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering#Retrieval-augmented_generation">Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</a>,
someone inevitably thinks. The most successful applications will use techniques like that, but
currently that's not what most people are interacting with. Maybe one day.</p>
<div class="aside">
    <div class="aside-title"><p>internet advertisements</p>
</div>
    
    
    <p>Let's visit our old friend internet advertisements again! Not many people are going to pay $20
or $10 or even $5 for a Generative AI assistant. So you'd better be fucking ready for the
coming boom of juicy Coca Cola descriptions in the middle of your generated text.</p>

    
</div>
<p>Even if Copilot is admittedly probably going to be very useful for developers, developers
are a tiny fraction of the addressable market (every person on the internet).</p>
<p>Microsoft is losing <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/microsoft-is-reportedly-losing-huge-amounts-of-money-on-github-copilot">$80 per copilot user per month</a>,
and the AI revolution isn't exactly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911059/ai-climate-impact-google-openai-chatgpt-energy">environmentally friendly</a>
either. That might change though: hardware and software will keep getting better, but will we
put that to good use or will we use the slack to create even bigger things?</p>
<p><strong>Grade: C</strong></p>
<p>Bottom line: Has a lot of utility when applied right, but we have yet to apply it to many
things that are not Very Stupid.</p>
