<p>I generally know what's installed and running on my home computers, but I don't know
what's running on managed devices like Zigbee temperature loggers, Sonos speakers,
or Chromecasts. I finally managed to segment my home network into multiple VLANs
to achieve defence in depth<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#defence_in_depth">1</a></sup>.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I use a
<em>Dream Machine Pro</em> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#dream_machine_pro">2</a></sup> as my router,
which is mounted in a 19"/37U rack. I've always dreamed of having my own rack (weird?),
and now I have one — which feels great. The next thing on my list of wants for my
homelab is a 1U or 2U RISC-V server. We're probably a few years from being able to buy actually
good RISC-V commodity servers though.</p>
<p>When I got the Dream Machine Pro, I started out by creating a Guest network, but
I hesitated creating an IoT network since I thought it would be a pain to
move my devices over to the new network — and I was right, more on that later.
The latest OpenSSH vulnerability, nicknamed regreSSHion<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#regresshion">3</a></sup>,
was the last nail in the coffin for me. RegreSSHion isn't particularly related to
rogue IoT devices, rather an increasing feeling of dread about how much bad C-code is running
24/7 in my home.</p>
<p>To get started, I needed some help, so I followed the steps in the excellent
YouTube tutorial<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#crosstalk_yt">4</a></sup> by Crosstalk Solutions, but that
video is from July 2021 — almost 3 years ago. It was relatively simple
to follow along, it was just a matter of finding where Ubiquiti had moved things
in their UI since then.</p>
<p>When I told my friend Markus what I was doing, he joked that in 1999 his father
had been right about the evil printer in their house and how it would spread
viruses to their computer. After that I decided to move my printer into the IoT
network, too.</p>
<h1 id="legacy-network-topology">Legacy network topology</h1>
<p>Before restructuring my network setup I had my Default network and one Guest
network, with them being segmented like this. The Guest network has access to
the internet, but can't access anything in the Default network. The Default
network can't access anything in the Guest network either. This is handled by
the Dream Machine Pro's "Guest network" feature, that can be set as an option
when creating a network. No additional firewall configuration is necessary.</p>

<p>Which, honestly, doesn't say much. I'll try to give a few details.</p>
<p>The key thing is to not subnet yourself into a hole<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#jessfraz_subnet">5</a></sup> while doing this —
in other words making sure that the VLAN you're in doesn't get firewalled in a
way that makes it impossible to get out of without doing a factory reset on the router.</p>
<h2 id="virtual-network-wifi">Virtual Network &amp; WiFi</h2>
<p>The first step is to add a new VLAN. It can be added under
Network &gt; Settings &gt; Networks. I called my network IOT and gave it the IP range
10.7.0.0/24. My Default network already has 10.6.0.0/24 and my Guest network has
192.168.1.0/24.</p>
<p>Then I assigned a new WiFi SSID called WiFi-IoT and connected it to the IOT VLAN.</p>
<h2 id="ip-groups">IP Groups</h2>
<p>Time to create the following IP Groups, which can be done under
Network &gt; Settings &gt; Profiles &gt; IP Groups.</p>
<div class="hscroll">
    <table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Settings</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Local Network RFC1918</td><td>IPv4 Address/Subnet</td><td><ul><li>10.0.0.0/8</li><li>192.168.0.0/16</li><li>172.16.0.0/12</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>IoT to Other GW block</td><td>IPv4 Address/Subnet</td><td><ul><li>10.6.0.1</li><li>192.168.1.1</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>All GW Addresses</td><td>IPv4 Address/Subnet</td><td><ul><li>10.6.0.1</li><li>192.168.1.1</li><li>10.7.0.1</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>UDM-pro access ports</td><td>Port Group</td><td><ul><li>80</li><li>443</li><li>22</li></ul></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</div>
<h2 id="firewall-rules">Firewall rules</h2>
<p>And then, the all-important firewall rules, which are configured under
Network &gt; Settings &gt; Security &gt; Traffic &amp; Firewall Rules. All of these rules need to
be marked "Before predefined".</p>
<div class="hscroll">
    <table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Action</th><th>Source</th><th>Destination</th><th>Match State</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Allow established &amp; related</td><td>LAN In</td><td>Accept</td><td>Any</td><td>Any</td><td>MANUAL: Established, Related</td></tr>
<tr><td>Allow Default to anywhere</td><td>LAN In</td><td>Accept</td><td>Network &gt; Default</td><td>Port/IP Group &gt; Local Network RFC1918</td><td>AUTO</td></tr>
<tr><td>Block inter-VLAN traffic</td><td>LAN In</td><td>Drop</td><td>Port / IP Group &gt; Local Network RFC1918</td><td>Port/IP Group &gt; Local Network RFC1918</td><td>AUTO</td></tr>
<tr><td>Block IoT To GW</td><td>LAN Local</td><td>Drop</td><td>Network &gt; IOT</td><td>Port/IP Group &gt; IoT to Other GW block</td><td>AUTO</td></tr>
<tr><td>Block IoT from UDM-Pro access</td><td>LAN Local</td><td>Drop</td><td>Network &gt; IOT</td><td>Port/IP Group &gt; [Address Group] All GW Addresses, [Port Group] UDM-pro access ports</td><td>AUTO</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</div>
<p>The first rule, <em>Allow established &amp; related</em>, has to be the top / first one. It
allows network connections to be established between the networks, and importantly
it lets the IoT network connect back to the Default network once a device in the
Default network has initiated a connection.</p>
<p>The second rule, <em>Allow Default to anywhere</em>, lets the Default network talk to any
local network in the RFC1918 address space.</p>
<p>The third rule, <em>Block inter-VLAN traffic</em>, blocks all other inter-RFC1918 traffic.</p>
<p>The fourth rule, <em>Block IoT To GW</em>, blocks the IoT network from accessing the gateway
IP-addresses in the Default network and the Guest network.</p>
<p>And lastly, The fifth rule, <em>Block IoT from UDM-Pro access</em>, blocks the IoT network
from accessing the management interfaces on the router (ports 80, 443, and 22),
without blocking it from accessing the gateway functionality it needs.
The fourth rule already blocks the IoT network completely from the gateway interfaces on the
Default network and the Guest network, so this technically only blocks it from
the management ports on the IoT gateway, but the rule still prohibits the ports
on all the gateways. Doing it like that prevents future changes from introducing
mistakes — even though mistakes are still possible.</p>
<div class="aside">
    <div class="aside-title"><p>The firewall rules, working together</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>Established &amp; related connections are allowed, but unestablished or unrelated
connections are denied. In the diagram we see communication between the Default
network and the IoT network when the Default network initiates the connection.
We also see that when the IoT network initiates a connection, and it is unestablished
or unrelated, it is denied.</p>

    
</div>
<h2 id="mdns-discovery">mDNS discovery</h2>
<p>To get mDNS discovery working between the Default network and the IoT network,
you need to set up "IoT Auto-Discovery" under
Network &gt; Settings &gt; Networks &gt; Multicast Settings &gt; IoT Auto-Discovery, click
edit and make sure the Default and IOT networks are both in the list.</p>
<h1 id="moving-my-iot-devices-over-to-the-new-wifi-iot-ssid">Moving my IoT devices over to the new WiFi-IoT SSID</h1>
<p>This was more painful than I had hoped it would be. More painful than it <em>needs</em> to be.
I thought moving the Chromecast would be the easiest, then the Sonos and I honestly
thought my Nedis Zigbee hub thing would be the most painful. Boy was I wrong!</p>
<p>The Sonos and the Chromecast were absolutely terrible to move over. Required a
total factory reset of both devices. Is this the level of configurability we
should expect from billion-dollar companies? I wasted a lot of time trying to
figure out how to move them over, but it seems like it simply isn't possible
to change the SSID or password on those devices, once configured. Let me know
if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>The Nedis Zigbee thing was a breeze, took like 2 minutes. I guess that's the difference
several billion dollars make.</p>
<h1 id="future-improvements">Future improvements</h1>
<p>One big thing would be to let the Guest network be able to access the IoT network
to be able to use my Chromecasts, Sonos, etc. That would require me to stop
using the convenient "Guest network" feature, but it shouldn't be too complicated
to add the necessary firewall rules manually.</p>
